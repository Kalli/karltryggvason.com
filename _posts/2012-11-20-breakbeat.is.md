I was part of the great bunch of people running [Breakbeat.is](http://www.breakbeat.is "Breakbeat.is").

Breakbeat.is was dedicated to nurturing and promoting the Icelandic drum & bass, dubstep and jungle scene from 2000 till 2013.

Our efforts were three fold:

1. A web community centered on the Icelandic drum & bass, jungle, dubstep and breakbeat scene.

2. A weekly radio show on local FM station X-ið 97.7.

3. Reykjavík’s longest running club night, first Thursday of every month for 13 years.

You can still check out our [website](http://www.breakbeat.is "Breakbeat.is") and listen to archived episodes of our [podcast](http://www.breakbeat.is/podcast.html "Breakbeat.is Podcast").
