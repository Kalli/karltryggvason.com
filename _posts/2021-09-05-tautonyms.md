overview: My mission to see all species with tautonym zoological names.   
---

I like repetition, duplication and loops, so I am fascinated by [*tautonyms*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautonym)[^2]:

> A tautonym is a scientific name of a species in which both parts of the name have the same spelling, for example, *Rattus rattus*.[^1]

{% include image.html url="/img/thumbs/tautonyms.jpg" description="Anser anser - the greylag goose." %}

I want to see as many animals with tautonymic names as possible. Below is the list of the ones I've seen (confirmed and dated with photographic or audio evidence)[^3]. 

### My list (so far)

* [Anser anser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylag_goose) - the greylag goose - 16.07.2020, Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands.    
* [Capreolus capreolus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_deer) - Western roe deer - 08.07.2021, Dyrehaven, Denmark.
* [Carduelis carduelis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_goldfinch)- The European goldfinch - 16.06.2023
* [Ciconia ciconia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_stork) - the white stork - 17.07.2020, Rijpwetering, The Netherlands.
* [Gallinago gallinago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_snipe) - the common snipe - 23.06.2019, Fellsm√∂rk, Iceland (my favourite bird!)
* [Pyrrhula pyrhulla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_bullfinch) - Eurasian bullfinch - 02.04.2023.
* [Vulpes vulpes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox) - the red fox.

Then there are a few that I've definitely seen in the (semi)-wild but either it was before I started keeping track or it was without evidence or documentation: 

* [Rattus rattus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rat) - the black rat.
* [Apus apus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_swift) - the common swift.
* [Bufo bufo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_toad) - the common toad (not to be confused with Ben UFO aka BUFO one of my favourite dj's who I've also seen in the wild).

Domestic animals or animals seen in captivity don't count towards my list.

### Favourites

Here's some of my favourite tautonyms, I hope I have a chance to see these one day: 

* [Chaos chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(genus)) - a single-celled amoeboid organism.
* [Tubifex tubifex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubifex_tubifex) also known as the Boogie Worm.
* [Extra extra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_extra) (read all about it) - a minute sea snail.
* [Hippopus hippopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopus_hippopus) - a giant clam aka the Horse Hoof clam.
* [Redunca redunca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohor_reedbuck) - the bohor reedbuck.


### More tautonyms

An incomplete list of [tautonyms can be found on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tautonyms), there's at least 500 of them, so quite a lot to get to! Then there are also [triple tautonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_triple_tautonyms) where the generic name, the specific name and the subspecies have the same name ([*Pica pica pica*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_magpie#Subspecies) is my fav, for pokemon and Icelandic vulgarity related reasons).

Though it recognition algorithm is kind of magical it is a bit frustrating when it does not recognise animals (or worse still misidentifies, like when it told me I'd seen [Axis axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chital) in the wild in Denmark).
