An [electronic music data visualization project](https://lazilyevaluated.co/clubster-analysis) Clubster Analysis is a data dig into the bookings at some of the biggest nightclubs in the world. 

>How similar or different are the line ups of the most popular nightclubs in the world? Which clubs rely on residents and which have endlessly rotating talent? How similar are the bookings of clubs in different countries and continents? Are the super clubs different from the underground venues? In an attempt to answer these questions and others like them we looked at the most recommended clubs for the most popular regions on the reputable website [Resident Advisor (RA)](https://ra.co).

Take a look to see how your favourite club fits in on [Lazily Evaluated.co](https://lazilyevaluated.co/) or you can see a quick preview below.
