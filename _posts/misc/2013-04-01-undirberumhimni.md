Website for the outdoors art exhibition *[Undir Berum Himni (Under the Open Sky)](http://undirberumhimni.is)* was made by [Leopold](http://www.leopold.is) and me.

>An outdoor art exhibition of more than 100 artists, *Under the Open Sky* provides a unique opportunity to see the works of some of Iceland’s best known, as well as emerging, artists. The exhibition takes place in public spaces and private gardens in the center of Reykjavík and the artworks range from sculptures to paintings, performances and graffiti, giving a good overview of the diversity of Reykjavík’s contemporary art scene.
