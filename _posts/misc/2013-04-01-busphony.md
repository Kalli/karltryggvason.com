Busphony was a location based browser-syntheziser powered by the busses of Reykjavik. The real time locations of the busses of the Icelandic capital region would trigger distinct synthesizer notes. The result was a pretty horrid but mildly amusing cacophony. 

Originally conceived as a way to notify me when my local bus was getting close it was expanded for the lolz. Due to changes in the [Bus.is](https://bus.is) and Google Maps apis it is unfortunately no longer available. But you can still find the code on [Github](http://www.github.com/kalli/busphony) if you are interested.
