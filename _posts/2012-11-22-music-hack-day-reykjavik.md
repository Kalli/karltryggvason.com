Along with [Johan](http://www.freenerd.de "Freenerd.de") and [Andie](http://log.andie.se "Andie.se") I  organized the first [Icelandic edition](http://reykjavik.musichackday.org) of [Music Hack Day](http://www.musichackday.org "MusicHackDay.org"), an international 24 hour hackathon on music and technology.

>*Music Hack Day is an international 24-hour event where programmers, designers and artists come together to conceptualize, build and demo the future of music. Software, hardware, mobile, web, instruments, art - anything goes as long as it’s music related*.

Music Hack Day Reykjavik took place at Reykjavik University on october 27th-28th. There were around 80 hackers in attendance and 27 [hacks were completed](http://wiki.musichackday.org/index.php?title=Reykjav%C3%ADk_Hacks_2012). You can watch [the demos](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/music-hack-day-reykjav%C3%ADk-2012) for more information.

Organizing Music Hack Day was hectic but a lot of fun, I got to know a lot of interesting and talented people and saw some pretty amazing hacks. I have since attended another [MHD in London](http://london.musichackday.org/2012) where I created a hack called [_Heartbeatmatch_](http://london.musichackday.org/2012"Heartbeatmatch"). I should like to attend more hack days and hackathons in the future and hope to take part in organizing more off them too.

In the run up to MHD Reykjavik I gave a [presentation](http://media.karltryggvason.com/mhd/mhd-presentation-english.pdf) on Music Hack Day and talked about MHD and hackathons in general on [Icelandic Radio 1](http://media.karltryggvason.com/mhd/vidsja_-_mhd_24102012.mp3)
