I'm fond of writing and should like to do more of it. I've written on various topics, including music, technology and culture. In addition to my [blog](http://blog.karltryggvason.com) I have written pieces for numerous outlets through out the years, some of which can be found below.

[DansiDans](http://www.dansidans.com "DansiDans.com") is an icelandic blog about electronic dance music, if you know "íslenska" it is worth a read in my humble opinon. We also have a [great podcast](http://dansidans.com/category/podcast/ "DansiDans Podcast") with icelandic dj's and producers. DansiDans has been a bit neglected as of late but hopefully that will change soon.

[Resident Advisor](http://www.residentadvisor.net/ "Resident Advisor") is a reputable dance music portal. I did [some music reviews](http://www.residentadvisor.net/profile/hume/contrib?all=reviews#reviews "Reviews") for them a couple of years back.

I have also written about music and culture for Morgunblaðið (Icelands biggest and oldest subscription daily) and Stúdentablaðið (Student Magazine of the University of Iceland).
