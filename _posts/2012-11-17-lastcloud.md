*Lastcloud* was a webapp I made with my friend [Leópold](http://www.leopold.is "Leópold Kristjánsson"). Based on your [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm "Last.fm") data it would find [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com "Mixcloud") cloudcasts with some of your favorite artists.

The backend is in Python/Django with some javascript/jQuery magic on the frontend. You can check out the code on [Github](https://github.com/Kalli/lastcloud "Lastcloud on Github"). Unfortunately the Mixcloud api has since changed so it's no longer possible to try out the live version!
