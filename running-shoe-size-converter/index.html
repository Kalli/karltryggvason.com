                Ever noticed how your shoe size can vary between different running brands? For example, a size 46 in Asics might feel more like a 45 in New Balance, or a Mizuno might feel half a size snugger than a Nike.
            </p>
            <p>
                This converter helps you determine equivalent sizes across different brands and size types. Here's how to use it:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Select a shoe brand and size that you know fits you well.</li>
                <li>Choose the brand you want to find an equivalent size for.</li>
                <li>The tool will display the recommended size for the selected brand.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Our comparisons are based on charts from <a href="https://www.runningxpert.com/en/inspiration/running-shoe-size-guide">Running Xpert</a>, which uses the <abbr title="Centimeters">CM</abbr> (or <abbr title="Japanese size">JP</abbr>) measurements of different brands for accurate comparisons.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> This converter is for reference only. Always try on shoes for proper feel and fit before purchasing!
